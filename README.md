## who dis?

i'm brian, aka ironprogrammer, wordpress core contributor and plugin hacker. i've worked for automattic as a full-time sponsored contributor, and for over a decade helped run a marketing agency pushing wordpress on all our clients (and got to do a bunch of amazing things for them). there's other stuff in [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianalexander/), but i'm still kinda in love with wordpress.

to dig more into my wordpress open source work, head to [my wporg profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/) or look me up in [core trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=props+ironprogrammer&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&ticket=on). i've [contributed to core since 5.9](https://peterwilson.cc/wordpress-contribution-history/?wp-credit-history-username=ironprogrammer), served as test team rep, joined release squads, and posted a bit in the [core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/author/ironprogrammer/) and [test](https://make.wordpress.org/test/author/ironprogrammer/) blogs.
