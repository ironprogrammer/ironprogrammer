## who dis?

i'm brian, aka ironprogrammer, full stack dev, wordpress core contributor, and plugin hacker. i've worked for [automattic](https://automattic.com/) as a full-time sponsored contributor, and for over a decade helped run a [marketing agency](https://oakcreektrail.com) pushing wordpress and marketing automations on all our clients (and got to do a bunch of amazing things for them). there's also other stuff in [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianalexander/).

to dig more into my wordpress open source work, head to [my wporg profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/) or look me up in [core trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=props+ironprogrammer&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&ticket=on). i've [contributed to core since 5.9](https://peterwilson.cc/wordpress-contribution-history/?wp-credit-history-username=ironprogrammer), served as test team rep, joined release squads, and posted a bit in the [core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/author/ironprogrammer/) and [test](https://make.wordpress.org/test/author/ironprogrammer/) blogs.

i'm still in search of my next adventure for a great work/culture fit. check out [my website](https://brianalexander.com/) or [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianalexander/) to learn more about me.

### what's new?
- i've recently been hammering away on an organizer-focused pickleball scheduling platform, [dinkround.com](https://dinkround.com). i work with several local pickleball group organizers so have a keen understanding of the challeges they face. currently beta testing with over 100 players.
- do you use safari and like pretty icons in github? check out [github-material-icons-userscript](https://github.com/ironprogrammer/github-material-icons-userscript) and let me know what you think.
- got a school-aged swimmer in oregon? got motivational times for state championship qualification? check out [swimcheck.org](https://swimcheck.org) and ditch the pdf that osi publishes.
- what? another plugin? yep, musicians (especially you drummers) should also check out my [setlist-player](https://github.com/ironprogrammer/setlist-player) plugin. it features keyboard controls to easily move between tracks and adjust playback speed for practice sessions, something [i've been doing](https://github.com/ironprogrammer/chatgpt-youtube-app) in one form or another for a couple years now, but now available in plugin form.
- install (and test!) my new [pickleball ratings](https://github.com/ironprogrammer/pickleball-ratings) plugin and easily share your dupr with the world! (wait, [what's pickleball?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball), and [what's dupr?](https://www.dupr.com/post/what-is-a-pickleball-rating))
